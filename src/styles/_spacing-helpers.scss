  This .scss loop will create "margin helpers" and "padding helpers" for use in your web projects.

  It will generate several classes such as:
  .m-r-10 which gives margin-right 10 rem.
  .m-r-15 gives MARGIN to the RIGHT 15 rem.
  .m-t-15 gives MARGIN to the TOP 15 rem and so on.
  .p-b-5 gives PADDING to the BOTTOM of 5 rem
  .p-l-40 gives PADDING to the LEFT of 40 rem

  The first letter is "m" or "p" for MARGIN or PADDING
  Second letter is "t", "b", "l", or "r" for TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, or RIGHT
  Third letter is the number of spacing in rem. Adjust the amounts generated by editing the $spaceamounts variable below.
